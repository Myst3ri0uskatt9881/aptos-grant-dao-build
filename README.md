# Aptos Grant DAO Build

This repository contains the project proposal and materials for submission to the **Aptos Grant DAO – Round 8**, hosted by DoraHacks.

## Project Overview

**Aptos Grant DAO Build is an innovative decentralized application built on the Aptos blockchain that enables communities to post, store, and retrieve messages on-chain in a transparent and immutable way. It functions as a lightweight, public communication layer where users can interact directly through smart contracts without relying on centralized servers.

The project addresses the lack of simple, on-chain communication primitives within emerging ecosystems by offering a scalable and secure Move-based contract that stores user-submitted content. Paired with a user-friendly React frontend and a Flask backend for additional integrations, it provides an end-to-end example of building decentralized public goods on Aptos.

This project aligns with Aptos’ mission to foster a high-performance, user-first ecosystem by demonstrating how developers can quickly deploy, interact with, and scale dApps using the Aptos Move stack and development tools.


## Track

Selected Track: DAO / Social / Infrastructure

This project falls under the DAO and Social tracks by enabling decentralized community engagement through an on-chain messaging system governed by smart contracts. Additionally, it contributes to the Infrastructure track by demonstrating a composable and extensible Move-based foundation that other projects can build upon.


## Key Features
